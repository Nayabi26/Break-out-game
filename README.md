# Break-out-game
I learned about breakout game and its technique through mdn code tutorial which is very effective to a newbie .
Now i would like to recreate the game by myself .
This game will have levels from 1 to 3 , where level 1 will only have 3 brick and slow speed ball , when level increase number of bricks will increase as well as speed of the ball.
By adding tweaks on the code will make game more interactive and challenging .
